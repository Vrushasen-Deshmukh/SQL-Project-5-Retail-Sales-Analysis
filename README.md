# SQL-Project-5-Retail-Sales-Analysis

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

# Objectives
Set up a retail sales database: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
Data Cleaning: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
Business Analysis: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

# Key Findings
1. Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05'.

3. Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales(total_sales) for each category.
4. Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.
5. Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale > 1000.
6. Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions(transactions_id) made by each gender in each category.
7. Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year.
8. Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales.
9. Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.
10. Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders(Example Morning<=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17).
